As the question says:
for (int i	=	0,j	=	0;	i	<	10;	i++,j--)	{
				System.out.print(j);
}
Code	Output
0123456789

But if we do dry run for this code:
This code initializes two variables, i and j, both starting with a value of 0. The loop runs as long as i is less than 10, and in each iteration, i is incremented (i++) and j is decremented (j--). The System.out.print(j) statement prints the current value of j in each iteration.

Now let's trace the loop:
Iteration 1: i=0, j=0 (prints 0)
Iteration 2: i=1, j=-1 (prints -1)
Iteration 3: i=2, j=-2 (prints -2)
... and so on.
The correct output should be: 0-1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9

So, the correct output does not match the provided "0123456789". The correct output includes negative numbers because j is being decremented in each iteration.
There is a printing issue provided inside the pdf.
